# How it works

poloLender Pro is:

- an **open source** application written in JavaScript
- runs on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- can either run locally on your computer or can be hosted on a cloud platform (e.g. [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com "Heroku")).

poloLender Pro is an automatic bot which lends funds on Poloniex exchange.

The lending rate is calculated using  statistical calculation in order to maximize profits.

poloLender Pro does not calculate the lending rate itself, instead the poloLender Pro receives the lending rate from **poloLending-Advisor** server.
**poloLending-Advisor** is an on-line server hosed at [http://safe-hollows.crypto.zone](http://safe-hollows.crypto.zone "http://safe-hollows.crypto.zone").

In order to calculate optimal lend offer rate, the server continuously monitors the lend-book (active offers) and also calculates the average loan holding time.
Based on this data and using statistical calculation **poloLending-Advisor** server can inform poloLender Pro clients of the rate with best profit returns.

By using historical information and statistical calculation poloLender Pro is able to give better return rates, as comparing with placing offers only looking at a snapshot of the lend book.

## Why using statistical calculation is more efficient

As it can be seen in the screen-shot below, poloLender Pro, manages to place offers with good rates

### Other bots

Other existing bots are placing loan offers by only looking at a snapshot of the lend-book (active offers available at one point in time).
To find out why snapshot of the lend-book does not give information on best return rate, I have written a bot that places small lend offers at the top of the lend-book every minutes.

As you can see in the screen-shot below, often **the lend book rates vary widely**.
For this reason, figuring out the rate that gives best result is not obvious.

In addition, placing offers "randomly" through the lend-book, expecting a spike is not most efficient.

# Setting up the application

Running on Heroku is highly recommended to ensure maximum up-time.


## Running locally

1. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

2. [Download and install the latest version of Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads "Download and install the latest version of Git")

3. Clone `poloLender` application source code from github:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/dutu/poloLender.git
    $ cd poloLender
    ```
4. Install the dependencies, preparing your system for running the app locally:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

5. Define config vars required for configuring poloLender:
    Rename the file `.env-template` to `.env`, then update the variables in `.env` file with your own values

5. Start the app locally:

    ```
    node server.js
    ```

## Running on Heroku


1. [Create a Heroku account]([https://signup.heroku.com/dc] "Create a Heroku account") if you don't have one already](http://www.heroku.com)

2. [Download and install the Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli "Download and install the Heroku CLI")
Once installed, you'll have access to the heroku command from your command shell.

3. Log into Heroku:

    ```
    $ heroku login
    ```

4. Clone `poloLender` application source code from github:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/dutu/poloLender.git
    $ cd poloLender
    ```
5. Create an app on Heroku and deploy the code

    ```
    $ heroku create
    $ git push heroku master
    $ heroku ps:scale web=0 poloLender=0
    ```

6. Provision the [papertrail](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/papertrail) logging add-on
    ```
    $ heroku addons:create papertrail
    ```

    Note: To help with abuse prevention, Heroku requires account verification for provisioning an add-on . If your account has not been verified, you will be directed to visit the verification site.


7. Open the papertrail console to see the log messages.
    ```
    $ heroku addons:open papertrail
    ```
> Note: Keep the papertrail console open to monitor progress

8. Define config vars required for configuring poloLender (replace the values below with your own)
    ```
    $ heroku config:set POLOLENDER_APIKEY='{"key":"V********t","secret":"T***u"}'
    $ heroku config:set POLOLENDER_STARTTIME='2016-02-28T12:27:09+00:00'
    $ heroku config:set POLOLENDER_STARTBALANCE='{"BTC":"10", "ETH":"1100", "XMR":"1000", "XRP":"80000", "DASH":"10000"}'
    $ heroku config:set POLOLENDER_LENDMAX='{"BTC":"4", "ETH":"100", "XMR":"2000", "XRP":"30000", "DASH":"0"}'
    $ heroku config:set POLOLENDER_MINRATE='{"BTC":"0.02", "ETH":"0", "XMR":"0.015", "XRP":"0", "DASH":"0"}'
    $ heroku config:set POLOLENDER_REPORTINTERVAL=60
    ```

9. Start the application
    ```
    heroku ps:scale poloLender=1
    ```

10. [Upgrade your application to Hobby](https://dashboard.heroku.com/# "upgrade to Hobby")
> **Note**: By default the Heroku applications run on Free dyno. Free dyno sleeps after a period of activity. Please see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#usage for details. It is highly recommended to upgrade the free Dyno to Hobby. Hobby dyno never sleeps. See: https://www.heroku.com/pricing
